# 🚀 My First React Project: Job Listing App

Welcome! This is my very first React application, created as I embark on my journey into React development. I built this project while following the excellent [React JS Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDB4uaJ87e0&list=PLillGF-RfqbYeckUaD1z6nviTp31GLTH8&index=9&t=1s) by Traversy Media on YouTube.

A huge thank you to Brad Traversy for the amazing crash course! This project marks my entry into the world of React, and I'm excited to continue learning and building more complex applications in the future.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Job Listing App** is a simple job board application where users can:
- View a list of job postings
- Add a new job
- Edit existing jobs
- Delete jobs
- View job details

This project was built as a hands-on exercise to learn the basics of React, including components, props, state, hooks, and routing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- [React](https://react.dev/) (with functional components & hooks)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (for fast development)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (for styling)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) (for navigation)

## 📦 Project Structure
- `src/components/` – Reusable UI components (Navbar, Card, Jobcard, etc.)
- `src/pages/` – Page components for different routes (Homepage, Add/Edit Job, Not Found, etc.)
- `src/layout/` – Main layout wrapper
- `src/jobs.json` – Sample job data

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd job-listing
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app in your browser.
